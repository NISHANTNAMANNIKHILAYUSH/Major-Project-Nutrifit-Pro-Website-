        <h2>What Are Sets and Reps?</h2>
        <p>When weight training, we’re often faced with the questions: How many sets and reps should I do? How much weight should I lift? Whether you’re looking to build muscle, increase strength, or burn fat, understanding the balance between sets, reps, and the weight choice is essential to achieving your goals.</p>
        <p>This guide breaks it all down so you can optimize your workouts and make every rep count.</p>

        <h2>Using Progressive Overload for Continuous Improvement</h2>
        <p>To continue making gains, you need to gradually increase the demand on your muscles. Here are a few ways to implement progressive overload:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increase Weight:</strong> Add more weight as you get stronger.</li>
            <li><strong>Increase Reps:</strong> Push for an extra rep or two with the same weight.</li>
            <li><strong>Increase Volume:</strong> Add more sets to your routine.</li>
            <li><strong>Decrease Rest Time:</strong> Challenge your endurance by reducing your rest between sets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do I know if I’m lifting the right weight?</h3>
            <p>If you’re aiming for strength or muscle growth, the weight should challenge you but still allow for proper form. The last 1-2 reps of each set should feel tough but achievable without sacrificing technique.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>Should I increase weight or reps first?</h3>
            <p>This depends on your goal. For strength, prioritize increasing weight before reps. For muscle endurance or hypertrophy, consider increasing reps first to maximize time under tension.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>How many times per week should I work out?</h3>
            <p>This depends on your fitness level and goals. For strength or hypertrophy, training 3-5 times per week is typically ideal. Beginners may start with 2-3 sessions per week, while more advanced athletes may work out 5-6 times.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>What is progressive overload, and why is it important?</h3>
            <p>Progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress placed on the body during exercise. It’s crucial for muscle growth, strength, and continuous improvement because it ensures your muscles are consistently challenged and forced to adapt.</p>
