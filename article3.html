        <h2>What Is Leg Day and Why Is It Important?</h2>
        <p>Your legs are home to some of the largest and strongest muscles in your body, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. Training these muscles improves lower-body strength and your overall functional fitness.</p>
        <p>Here are a few reasons why you should never skip leg day:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved Strength and Power:</strong> Training your legs with exercises like squats, lunges, and deadlifts helps you develop powerful leg muscles that are essential for a strong foundation.</li>
            <li><strong>Boosts Metabolism:</strong> Since leg exercises engage large muscle groups, they burn a significant amount of calories, contributing to fat loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Balanced Physique:</strong> Strengthening your legs ensures you build a proportionate and strong lower body to complement your upper-body gains.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Mobility and Flexibility:</strong> Leg day exercises improve your range of motion and joint flexibility, reducing stiffness and improving your overall movement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Role of Legs in Everyday Functionality</h2>
        <p>Leg muscles play a fundamental role in everyday movements, from walking to standing and even sitting correctly. A weak lower body can make these tasks more difficult, while a strong lower body enhances agility and stability.</p>
        <p>Training your legs can also lead to an increase in hormonal production, promoting overall muscle growth and recovery.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="muscle-groups" class="container">
        <h2>Major Muscle Groups Targeted on Leg Day</h2>
        <p>Understanding the major muscle groups targeted during leg workouts is essential:</p>

        <h3>1. Quadriceps (Quads)</h3>
        <p>The quadriceps are located at the front of your thigh and are responsible for knee extension. They are heavily activated in exercises like squats and lunges.</p>

        <h3>2. Hamstrings</h3>
        <p>Located at the back of your thigh, the hamstrings help flex the knee and extend the hip, making them essential for exercises like Romanian deadlifts.</p>

        <h3>3. Glutes</h3>
        <p>The glute muscles are crucial for hip extension and are engaged in exercises like squats and hip thrusts.</p>

        <h3>4. Calves</h3>
        <p>The calf muscles provide support when pushing off the ground and are essential for balance and posture.</p>

        <h3>5. Adductors</h3>
        <p>The adductor muscles are located on the inner thigh and play a key role in bringing your legs together, contributing to hip stability.</p>
